    Defines a data access object (DAO) for create, retrieve, update, and delete
    (CRUD) operations on users and roles. This DAO is needed in two places: (1)
    the Tahopen Administration Console for changing users and roles and (2) the
    Tahopen BI Platform for authentication. One implementation of IUserRoleDao
    is based on Hibernate. It uses Spring's HibernateDaoSupport. This package
    should not be confused with
    org.pentaho.platform.plugin.services.security.userrole which contains
    implementations of IUserRoleListService. IUserRoleListService is primarily
    used for UIs that need to present security-related information for reading
    only. Such a UI is the Permission interface in the legacy Tahopen BI
    Platform.
